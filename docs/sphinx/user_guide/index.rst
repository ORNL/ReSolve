User Guide
====================

Getting started
---------------
ReSolve is maintained and developed at `Github <https://github.com/ORNL/ReSolve>`_.
It has following build dependencies:

* C++11 compliant compiler
* CMake >= 3.22
* KLU, AMD and COLAMD libraries from SuiteSparse >= 5.0 (optional)
* CUDA >= 11.4 (optional)
* HIP/ROCm >= 5.6 (optional)


To acquire and build Re::Solve it is as easy as:

.. code:: shell

   $ git clone https://code.ornl.gov/peles/resolve.git
   $ mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake ../resolve
   $ make

Note if you don't include any of the optional dependencies, there will be
little functionality provided. You might want to use tool such as ``ccmake``
to enable features you need.

To install the library
----------------------

In the directory where you built the library run

.. code:: shell

   $ make install

To change the install location please use the CMAkePresets.json file as mentioned in `test and deploy <#test-and-deploy>`__

To run it, download `test linear systems <https://github.com/NREL/opf_matrices/tree/master/acopf/activsg10k>`__ 
and then edit script |runResolve|_ 
to match locations of your linear systems and binary installation.
The script will emulate nonlinear solver calling the linear solver repeatedly.

To use the ReSolve library in your own project
----------------------------------------------

Make sure Resolve library is installed (see above)

Below is an example CMakeList.txt file to use ReSolve library in your project

.. code:: cmake

   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20)
   project(my_app LANGUAGES CXX)

   find_package(ReSolve CONFIG 
     PATHS ${ReSolve_DIR} ${ReSolve_DIR}/share/resolve/cmake
     ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH ENV DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
     REQUIRED)

   # Build your executable 
   add_executable(my_app my_app.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE ReSolve::ReSolve)


Test and Deploy
---------------

ReSolve as a library is tested every merge request via Gitlab pipelines
that execute various library tests including a test of ReSolve being
consumed as package within an external project as mentioned in `Using
ReSolve in your own
Project <#to-use-the-resolve-library-in-your-own-project>`__

To test your own install of ReSolve simply cd into your ReSolve build
directory and run

.. code:: shell

   $ make test

or

.. code:: shell

   $ ctest

Below is an example of what a functional ReSolve build will ouput on
Passing tests

Important Notes
---------------

You can find default Cmake Configurations in the CMakePresets.json file,
which allows for easy switching between different CMake Configs. To
create your own CMake Configuration we encourage you to utlize a
CmakeUserPresets.json file. To learn more about cmake-presets please
checkout the cmake
`docs <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html>`__

For example if you wanted to build and install ReSolve on a High
Performance Computing Cluster such as PNNL’s Deception or ORNL’s Ascent
we encourage you to utilize our cluster preset. Using this preset will
set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to an install folder. To use this preset simply
call the preset flag in the cmake build step.

.. code:: shell

   cmake -B build --preset cluster
